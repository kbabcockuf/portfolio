<p>Below is a selection of professional projects on which I was (or am) the Lead Engineer.  In many cases, I am directly responsible for &gt;=80% of the code.  If not, I'll mention it!</p>

<p>To start with, here's a sample of a fun project I worked on a couple years ago.  Think Samsung SmartPause.</p>

<h3>
<a id="connected-device" class="anchor" href="#connected-device" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Connected Device</h3>

<p><a href="https://kindara.com/wink">Kindara Wink</a> - Accurate and precise Bluetooth LE thermometer automatically syncs temperatures to Kindara’s Android and iOS apps.  As the Lead Engineer at Kindara, I am directly responsible for the success of Wink, re-engineering the Embedded C firmware and iOS CoreBluetooth API, and completely scrapping the Android BLE API.  This is my proudest achievement as an engineer - I had barely written any C or C++ since university besides some NDK work on Android, and never written Embedded C and re-wrote 90% of the firmware in under six months after being hired as a senior Android resource.  While simultaneously handling the BLE integrations for both of Kindara's apps.  Whew!</p>

<h3>
<a id="android" class="anchor" href="#android" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Android</h3>

<p>Aerovironment ProCore - provides technicians an in-depth Bluetooth LE interface to ProCore charging stations to charge and configure industrial electric forklifts.</p>

<p>Samantha - App suite and SDK associates Android sensor data at 50hz, touch interaction, and packets collected from a Bluetooth LE GSR sensor.  This project grew from humble roots to demonstrate a BLE integration on Android to a suite of apps geared for researchers to understand how users interact with mobile devices.  Data is marshalled in real-time to SQLite and on to Google BigQuery in a multithreaded environment - the biggest challenge is how to handle data being generated at a rate that even high end Android devices could barely tolerate.</p>

<p>SaveIt- Archive and search texts, voicemails, and photos with this cloud-connected app and RESTFul server platform that provides custom voicemail greetings and recordings via Plivo. </p>

<p>Zymurgy - The American Hoymebrewer Association’s app provides seamless online-&gt;offline access and searching capabilities to the entire PDF archive of AHA’s flagship publication, Zymurgy. </p>

<h3>
<a id="ios" class="anchor" href="#ios" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iOS</h3>

<p>IDB GalleryX- Award-winning iPad app presents a virtual gallery of the Inter-American Development Bank’s art collection, served from a RESTful Web Api.</p>

<h3>
<a id="web" class="anchor" href="#web" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web</h3>

<p>E-LRNX - Electronic learning system provides a Web 2.0 interface to the World Bank’s operational lessons database, complete with Lucene full-text indexing and geographic search functions.</p>
