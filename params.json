  "body": "## It's Portfolio-rrific!\r\nBelow is a selection of professional projects on which I was (or am) the Lead Engineer.  In many cases, I am directly responsible for >=80% of the code.  If not, I'll mention it!.\r\n\r\nTo start with, check out my resume at https://github.com/kbabcockuf/portfolio/blob/master/KevinBabcock-Resume.pdf\r\n\r\n### Connected Device\r\n**[Kindara Wink](https://kindara.com/wink)** - Accurate and precise Bluetooth LE thermometer automatically syncs temperatures to Kindara’s Android and iOS apps.  As the Lead Engineer at Kindara, I am directly responsible for the success of Wink, re-engineering the Embedded C firmware and iOS CoreBluetooth API, and completely scrapping the Android BLE API.  This is my proudest achievement as an engineer - I had barely written any C or C++ since university besides some NDK work on Android, and never written Embedded C and re-wrote 90% of the firmware in under six months after being hired as a senior Android resource.  \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - simultaneously handling the BLE integrations for both of Kindara's apps while learning Embedded C on a peculiar Broadcom SoC.  Whew!\r\n\r\n### Android\r\n**[Aerovironment ProCore](http://www.posicharge.com/procore)** - In-depth interface for configuring electric forklifts via Bluetooth LE with over a hundred commands and settings.  API developed using Java generics.  I was responsible for the entire BLE Api and generic interfaces for the command set and guided UX development done by junior engineers.  \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - the ProCore charging stations aren't portable, so Aerovironment provided a simulator that runs on Windows, broadcast through a BLE chip-on-USB from the Windows machine.  To overcome situations where the simulator lagged behind development, or was non-functional early in the project, we developed an entire Mock BLE interface that simulated ProCore and used Dagger to inject either the Mock BLE or Actual BLE interfaces as necessary to continue moving forward.\r\n\r\n**Samantha** - App suite and SDK associates Android sensor data at 50hz, touch interaction, and packets collected from a Bluetooth LE GSR sensor.  This project grew from humble roots to demonstrate a BLE integration on Android to a suite of apps geared for researchers to understand how users interact with mobile devices.  Data is marshalled in real-time to SQLite and on to Google BigQuery in a multithreaded environment.  \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - how to handle data being generated at a rate that even high end Android devices could barely tolerate.\r\n\r\n**[SaveIt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tricoastal.saveit)** - Securely archive and search texts, voicemails, and photos on a RESTful server platform that provides voicemail greetings and recordings via Plivo.  This was my baby for about 3 months straight last summer.  Although the idea behind SaveIt is so-so, the engineering was a lot of fun.  I designed and implemented the entire backend RESTful Web Api, cloud storage, and integration with Plivo.  I also lead engineering on the Android app with part time help from a talented junior engineer.  \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - fishing text messages from the content provider.  Every manufacturer decided to store SMS and MMS just a little bit differently.  Like everything on Android.\r\n\r\n**[Zymurgy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zymurgy)** - Magazine app provides seamless online and offline access and searching capabilities to the entire PDF archive of AHA’s flagship publication, Zymurgy.  My shining NDK experience.  I hacked apart MuPDF - an outstanding LGPL PDF library for Android - and added some nifty chrome around it to provide searching capabilities and other specifics requested by the AHA.  \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - lots of research in how to respect the LGPL license on MuPDF.  We kept the PDF library as a separate project that is called into from a single point of access, then hosted the library on a public GitHub repo (now hosted on my own repo...).\r\n\r\n### iOS\r\n**[IDB Gallery](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idb-gallery/id619335890)** - Award-winning iPad app presents a virtual gallery of the IDB’s art collection, served from a RESTful Web Api and custom CMS.  I developed the entire backend and was responsible for ~60% of the iOS code base. This is the one app I've done where I was backed up by world-class designers.  It's a shame the servers don't appear to be working, as the app doesn't move past the loading screen any longer. \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - the search map is actually two images - one grayscale and the other, completely transparent, has filled colors for each country.  When the user taps a country, we translate the coordinates - including handling pinch zooming on the grayscale map - onto the colored map, lookup a dictionary of hex colors to countries, and then search for that country.  We proceed to polyfill the grayscale map to show the selection. \r\n\r\n### Web\r\n**E-LRN** - Electronic learning system provides a Web 2.0 interface to the World Bank’s operational lessons database, complete with Lucene full-text indexing and geographic search functions.  My last hurrah in web development, this system had a lot of potential.  The searching capabilities and interface were truly first class, providing over 40 different criteria in a slick accordion-style interface.  The user could then display results either in list format, or geographically mapped via Google Maps, as each lesson was associated with a country.  \r\n\r\n_The biggest challenge_ - providing \"Google\" text searching for the lessons database via Lucene .NET.  Figuring out all the ins and outs of full text indexing, like choosing a stemmer, and how to rank search results based on the indexed fields that match, like a country field match outranks a match from a longer description field, was a project unto itself.\r\n\r\n### That's all for now\r\nHopefully these projects provide a glimpse into the varied technical background I bring to the table.  Unlike your typical \"generalist\", I dive head first into my projects, and make a point to become a specialist at whatever I'm working on.  These days, though, I want to keep diving deeper into connected devices and leave the web to the web developers.",
